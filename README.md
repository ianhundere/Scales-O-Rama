# Scales-O-Rama

## Synopsis
A python program that randomly selects music scales as well as allows the user to find scales based on any inputted notes that are then matched with minor, major, or any modal scale.


## Features
- Randomizes scales for the indecisive musician (e.g. major, minor, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, and locrian scales)
- Allows the user to find scales that matches their riffs
- The itertools module is used to flatten the dictionary of scales into values allowing scales to be randomized
- If the incorrect option is chosen, the user is alerted to enter either "lookup" or "random"

## Future Features
- Add sounds to mirror the chosen scale for the randomize function
- Add MIDI support to play scales via an instrument
